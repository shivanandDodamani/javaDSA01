Variables
A variable is a container (storage area) used to hold data.  
Each variable should be given a unique name (identifier).  

package com.apnacollege;

public class Main {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Variables
       String name = "Aman";
       int age = 30;

       String neighbour = "Akku";
       String friend = neighbour;
   }
}



Data Types
Data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of  data associated with variables which is essential to know since different data  types occupy different sizes of memory.

There are 2 types of Data Types :
Primitive Data types : to store simple values
Non-Primitive Data types : to store complex values
